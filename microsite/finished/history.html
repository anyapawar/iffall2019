					<h2>1955: <span class = "orange"> Miffy is Born</span></h2>

					<p>
					Miffy was created in 1955 after Bruna had been telling his one-year-old son, Sierk, stories about a little rabbit they had seen earlier in the dunes, while on holiday at Egmond aan Zee. Miffy became a female after Bruna decided he wanted to draw a dress and not trousers on his rabbit. Depending on the story, Miffy can range in age from being a baby to being four years old. 
					</p>

			</div>
					
			<div class = "innerhistory" id="1963" style="margin-top:50px;">
					<h2>1963: <span class = "orange"> Miffy is Stylized</span></h2>

					<p>
					At first Miffy looked like a toy animal with floppy ears, but by 1963, she looked the way we see her today, a stylized form of a rabbit. Miffy is drawn in a graphic style, with minimalist black graphic lines. Bruna chooses to only use black, white, the primary colors (red, yellow and blue), green, orange and brown. It is his use of primarily primary colors that makes Miffy instantly recognisable, and also popular with preschoolers, because of her bright and intense simplistic colors.
					</p>

			<div class = "innerhistory" id="1984" style="margin-top:50px">
					<h2>1984: <span class = "orange"> Miffy's First TV Show</span></h2>

					<p>
					Miffy appeared in her first TV show in 1984, called Dick Bruna's Miffy Storybook Classics: The Original Series. Each episode was traditionally animated and ran for approximately five minutes. The show aired in the Netherlands on KRO, in the United Kingdom on ITV, in Canada on TVOntario in Australia on ABC, and in the United States on PBS with VHS releases from Sony Wonder, episodes of the show were later included as Bonus Features on Miffy and Friends DVDs.

			<div class = "innerhistory" id="1990" style="margin-top:50px;">
					<h2>1990: <span class = "orange">Miffy as a Mascot</span></h2>

					<p>
					In the early 1990s, an image of Miffy holding an adjustable spanner coyly behind her back appeared on flyers produced by people taking direct action against the UK government's road building program. This unauthorised use of the character spread[3] and Miffy became a mascot for groups involved in radical ecological direct action.

			<div class = "innerhistory" id="1996" style="margin-top:50px">
					<h2>1996: <span class = "orange"> Miffy Takes Off</span></h2>

The show added several new characters, such as Melanie's African family and the family of Boris' and Barbara's common cousin, Umik. The series was produced by Pedri Animation BV, a Dutch stop-motion animation company. It was voiced simply by a feminine storytelling narrator.
