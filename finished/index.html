					<h2>the name miffy</h2>

					<p>
					In the Netherlands, Miffy is known as "nijntje", which derives from the Dutch word "konijntje", meaning "little bunny". This is a very logical name for anyone who speaks Dutch, but not in any other language.  This is because "Nijntje" is difficult to prounce for non-Dutch speakers and because there are so many different words for "bunny" in other languages, Dick Bruna’s little bunny is simply known as Miffy. The name doesn’t have any special meaning, but it is easy to pronounce in all languages. In the past, Miffy had a different name in every language. She was known as "le petit lapin" in French, for example, and as "kleintjie" in Afrikaans, but since 1996 she is known as Miffy everywhere outside the Netherlands.
