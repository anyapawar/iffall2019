<div class = "title"> [VERSE 1]</div> 
Now here you go again, you say<br>
You want your freedom<br>
Well who am I to keep you down?<br>
It's only right that you should<br>
Play the way you feel it<br>
But listen carefully to the sound<br>
Of your loneliness<br>
Like a heartbeat drives you mad<br>
In the stillness of remembering what you had<br>
And what you lost, and what you had, and what you lost<br><br>

<div class = "title"> [CHORUS]</div> 
<div class = "italic">
Thunder only happens when it's raining<br>
Players only love you when they're playing<br>
Say women they will come and they will go<br>
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know<br><br>
</div>

<div class = "title">[VERSE 2]</div> 
Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions<br>
I keep my visions to myself, it's only me<br>
Who wants to wrap around your dreams and,<br>
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?<br>
Dreams of loneliness,<br>
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad<br>
In the stillness of remembering, what you had,<br>
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost<br><br>

<div class = "title">[CHORUS]</div> 
<div class = "italic">
Thunder only happens when it's raining<br>
Players only love you when they're playing<br>
Women, they will come and they will go<br>
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know<br>
Thunder only happens when it's raining<br>
Players only love you when they're playing<br>
Say, women, they will come and they will go<br>
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know<br>
You'll know, you will know, you'll know<br><br><br><br><br>
